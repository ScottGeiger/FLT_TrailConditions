The Ithaca Transmission Project involves widening of the power lines that cross Rowland Ridge and eventual replacement of the lines with taller ones, which will result in eventual temporary closure of the FLT; some timber harvesting along the lines has already occurred on Cotton-Hanlon land and has caused minor disruptions to the FLT. Pink ribbons should be followed with confidence by those hiking in the area now. Future disruptions will surely follow, as NYSEG foresters cut the weed trees left standing by Cotton-Hanlon. Other landowners along the lines will also want to harvest valuable trees at some point, bringing further disruptions. Michele and I will try to stay on top of such developments with more pink ribbons. Some very muddy hiking ought to be expected along the power lines.\r\n\r\n</p><p>  Even worse, a whole new power line is going to be constructed parallel to the old one (on its south side), which will likely result in the FLT's temporary closure yet again.\r\n\r\n  </p><p> Since the SLT and Irvin Trail also cross the same current power lines three times, those trails will also be affected. \r\n\r\n </p><p>  Anyone planning to bag map M19 this summer really ought to try to get this section done in April, before it closes for May turkey hunting. NYSEG's summer construction plans may interfere later on, and will certainly interfere at some as of yet undetermined point.\r\n",

Near the trail register overlooking Fall Creek, you'll now find a rock bier held in place with locust posts to help prevent erosion, and a small foot bridge fashioned from locust with chainsaw, mattock, and axe. The group also put up a rope barrier at the top of the steepest section of cliff above the creek. And, the group filled in potholes with rock where the trail exits the woods and follows the edge of the fields. \r\n<p>The Friends of the Gorge is led by Marriane Krasny, faculty advisor, professor and Chair of the Natural Resources Department. Also in attendance were: Todd Miner from Cornell Outdoor Education, Michael Roberts, the crew leader, our own Tom Reimers, and 5 Cornell students.\r\n<p>The FOG has another work project planned for late October.",

(You can park on the side of the road -- just leave enough room for one lane of traffic, do not block any parked trailer or vehicle, and do not block any driveways). Heading east, follow old Moss Hill Rd. south, onto private lands. Pass around the right side of the yellow gate. Shortly after crossing into state land (So. Brad. SF), ascend hill and watch for 1st rerouted section to begin, on left.&nbsp; At bottom of hill, return to old trail on old road. Pick your way across wide pile of rocks carried onto trail by flash flooding (9/28/08 - 10\" rain).&nbsp; Turn left several hundred feet later, and descend to creek on dirt/stone ramp. Angle downstream, climb up opposite bank at first good opportunity, then move away from creek and follow top of gravel ridge to puncheon that bridges to old trail/roadbed. All blazed, but may be difficult to follow. Continue on old trail (old roadbed) till new trail veers off to your left. Relo returns to the old trail periodically, but also covers a lot of new (and much drier) ground. New outhouse roof and seat installed at shelter.</p>\r\n<p>The second relocated segment is between Dennis Rd. east to the creek at the bottom of the hill. Eight switchbacks with 10% grades have been built, to handle the steep slope (old trail had 35-45% grades!). Switchbacks all okay, but creek crossing also damaged by recent flash flooding. From Dennis Rd. heading east, follow the existing trail across the flat top and then descend till you encounter the new section. New section is blazed white; old section has been blocked off.</p>\r\n<p>The third relocated segment is between the creek at the bottom of the hill (east of Dennis Rd.) and Monterey/Sexton Hollow Rd. From the creek heading east, follow the existing trail till you encounter the new section (old trail going off to your right has been blocked off). New section follows pasture edge, then turns left and goes through older logged (sometimes wet) area, then turns right to head towards the trailhead, running parallel with (and fairly close to) Monterey/Sexton Hollow Rd.

Signage will be placed at both ends of our property's trail once actual cutting begins to increase hiker awareness for safety purposes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Harvested trees from our two neighbors to the east will also be taken out along our pink-ribboned log lane, since their properties, like ours, are blocked from access to the road by both the railroad and Devereaux Creek.</p>",
